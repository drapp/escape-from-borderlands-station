# Raid on Borderlands Station

A crossover adventure/puzzle game made for a birthday party in May 2015. The
adventure game references independent puzzles that exists in the real world can
be working on parallel to the game, making it a group activity. Not sure how useful this will be to anyone, but it's a functional Tads3 adventure game, and there weren't a huge number of easily accessible examples when I wrote this.

## Running

Get yourself [FrobTADS](http://www.tads.org/frobtads.htm) and then do
   
    t3make -d -f mygame && frob mygame

## Puzzles

Many of the referenced puzzles are in the `puzzles` directory (along with some random ones), but a few were purely physical, like the jigsaw. Check the code for explanations of what was supposed to happen for this puzzle.
